# AlienVkHeaven

### An attempt to render THE WORLD from the ground up. 
AlienVkHeaven is a hobby engine capable of loading scenes (similar to the Quake map format) and GLTF models. 
The end goal of this engine is to be capable of rendering fog. 

# Currently working on
- Shadow Mapping
    - Do some debugging
        - shadow acne
        - make sure orientations of shadow maps are correct
        - depth maps are really weird O_O


- Is it really necessary to keep transitioning layouts???

# Current Features
